												Spring ORM


Spring + ORM Frameworks( hibernate , toplink , iBatis ...) 

or also cld ad spring with ORM frameworks used for object relational mapping for accessing data

jdbc < hibernate < spring jdbc < spring orm 	// left to right  - better for data access

when we use spring orm  - 

	->we have to map class to database using xml or annotations 
		(ss42)
	
	-> Product Dao uses object of HibernateTemplate 
	   HibernateTemplate object of LocalSessionFactoryBean
	   LocalSessionFactoryBean  implements SessionFactory interface
	   LocalSessionFactoryBean uses objects of datasource,hibernateProperties,annotated class
	   	(ss47)

in this project we add dependency of hibernate bcoz we are using hiberate as ORM tool here.
and on including orm , jdbc is included by itself as it uses jdbc
